  "simo_que_es": "What is SIMOcore®?",
  "simo_p1": "SIMOcore® is an engineering approach that builds multivariable digital twins to simulate the real behavior of operational systems in mining, data centers, electricity and tunneling.",
  "simo_p2": "Unlike traditional studies, it allows evaluating multiple 'what if' scenarios, optimizing design and operation decisions, and reducing costs associated with failures and redesigns.",
  "simo_p3": "We apply tools like CFD, FEM, DEM, COMSOL and MATLAB in a dynamic environment, adjusted to real data and ready to iterate efficient solutions."
